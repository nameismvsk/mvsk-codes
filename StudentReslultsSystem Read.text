# Student Result System

---

## Overview
The **Student Result System** is a Java program that allows users (students) to log in using their **Registered ID** and **Name** to view their exam results. 
The program fetches data from a hardcoded database (`STUDENT_DB`) and calculates the total marks and percentage for the student while showing their subject-wise performance.
